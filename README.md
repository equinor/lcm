# Lost Circulation Material Optimizer

![CI](https://github.com/equinor/lcm/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

Web application for creating, comparing, and optimize blending of lost circulation material used to bridge fractures and stop losses in rock formations during petroleum drilling.

This repository is the result from the merger of the two summer intern projects from 2020.

- Team Blend <https://github.com/equinor/LCMLibrary-Blend>

## Interpolating new fraction data

Bridge data from products on a different scale than the one defined at `api/calculators/bridge.py:45` can be added to
the LCM optimizer as long as the data gets interpolated into the same scale.

That can be done like this;

1. Add a file at `./api/test_data/interpolate_input.csv`
2. Have the first column be called "Size" and have 101 measuring points of the products
3. Add one column for each product, where the header is the name of the product.
    ```csv
    Size,Prod1,Prod2
    0.01,0,0
    0.011482,0,0
    ...
    10000,100,100
    ```
4. Run `docker compose build api && docker compose run api python calculators/fraction_interpolator.py`
5. One result file for each product will be created in `./api/test_data/`

## Radix
Two different environments in Radix are used: one for test (deploys from branch "test") and one for production (deploy from branch "master")
